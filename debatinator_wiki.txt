The Debatinator [TODO: Example] allows readers of the nytimes.com to view a video of a debate (or speech) while following along with the debate's transcript. It also allows readers access to selected live blog posts, fact checks and other nytimes content in one single interface.

UPDATE: The debatinator backend and frontend was re-designed during the summer 2011 for the coming elections. The process of creating a debatinator has now hopefully become much easier.

=== What You Need === 
	* The debatinator backend works by annotating a Brightcove video. This means that you will need to upload the video of the debate to Brightcove and have the video ID ready to paste into the backend.

=== After the Event ===
	- From the reputable source of choice, get the transcript of the debate or speech
	- If you want to use content from the live dashboard (live blog, tweets, fact checks) you will need to find the URL to the live dashboard JSON file (ask Rune Madsen or David Nolen about this)
	- Go to the debatinator backend [TODO: Link] and follow the instructions
